## Mac Setup  {#mac_setup_title}

OSX comes prepackaged with PHP but it is normally a little behind the latest stable. Lion comes with PHP 5.3.6 and
Mountain Lion has 5.3.10.

To update PHP on OSX you can get it installed through a number of Mac [package managers][mac-package-managers], with
[php-osx by Liip][php-osx-downloads] being recommended.

The other option is to [compile it yourself][mac-compile], in that case be sure to have installed either Xcode or
Apple's substitute ["Command Line Tools for Xcode"][apple-developer] downloadable from Apple's Mac Developer Center.

For a complete "all-in-one" package including PHP, Apache web server and MySQL database, all this with a nice control
GUI, try [MAMP][mamp-downloads].
