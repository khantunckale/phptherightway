## PEAR {#pear_title}

Another veteran package manager that many PHP developers enjoy is [PEAR][1]. It behaves much the same way as Composer,
but has some noteable differences.

PEAR requires each package to have a specific structure, which means that the author of the package must prepare it
for usage with PEAR. Using a project which was not prepared to work with PEAR is not possible.

PEAR installs packages globally, which means after installing them once they are available to all projects on that
server. This can be good if many projects rely on the same package with the same version but might lead to problems
if version conflicts between two projects arise.

### How to install PEAR

You can install PEAR by downloading the phar installer and executing it. The PEAR documentation has detailed 
[install instructions][2] for every operating system.

If you are using Linux, you can also have a look at your distribution package manager. Debian and Ubuntu for example
have a apt ``php-pear`` package.

### How to install a package

If the package is listed on the [PEAR packages list][3], you can install it by specifying the official name:

    pear install foo
    
If the package is hosted on another channel, you need to `discover` the channel first and also specify it when 
installing. See the [Using channel docs][4] for more information on this topic.
